# API Stability Policy

We will not change the gonum/blas/... packages' exported API in backward incompatible ways.
Future changes to these packages will not break dependent code.

## Scope

This document is similar to and inspired by the [Go 1 compatibility
promise](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat) via Go kit [RFC007](https://github.com/go-kit/kit/blob/master/rfc/rfc007-api-stability.md).

### Coverage

The promise of stability includes:

* The package name,
* Exported type declarations and struct fields (names and types),
* Exported function and method names, parameters, and return values,
* Exported constant names and values,
* Exported variable names and values,
* The documented behavior of all exported code.

### Exceptions

* Unspecified behavior. Programs that depend on unspecified behavior may break
  in future releases.

* Bugs. If the package has a bug, a program that depends on the buggy behavior
  may break if the bug is fixed. We reserve the right to fix such bugs.

* Dot import of the blas/native package. If a program imports gonum/blas/native
  using import . "github.com/gonum/blas/native", additional names later defined
  in gonum/blas/native may conflict with other names defined in the program.
